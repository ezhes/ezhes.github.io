# Tall Tales of the Tailed Z's
A technical blog about terrible, horrible, no good, very bad ~~days~~ electronic things. 

### Hi! I'm Allison Husain
I'm a software engineer turned security researcher with a special interest in SoCs and CPU microarchitecture. I build operating systems, find and write zero-click chains, design and tapeout custom CPUs, and--from time to time--can be seen bombing hills on my rollerblades.

For a list of fun, worrying, or otherwise interesting things I've worked on, check out my [projects page]() or any of the posts on the side menu.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezhes_) or <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.online/@ezhes_">Mastodon</a>, I'm around :)
